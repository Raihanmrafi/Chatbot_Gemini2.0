🤖 Multimodal Gemini API Server
Welcome to Chatbot Gemini 2.0! This is a backend server built with Node.js and Express, serving as a powerful wrapper to leverage the multimodal capabilities of the Google Gemini 1.5 Flash model.

This server provides several simple API endpoints to interact with Gemini, allowing you to generate content from text, images, documents, and even audio.

✨ Key Features
Text-to-Text: Generate text-based content from a given prompt.

Image Analysis: Upload an image and ask questions about its content.

Document Q&A: Upload a document (like a PDF or TXT file) and let Gemini answer questions based on its content.

Audio Transcription & Analysis: Send an audio file to be transcribed or analyzed.

Automatic File Management: Uploaded files are automatically deleted from the server after processing to maintain cleanliness and efficiency.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js

AI Model: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash

File Handling: Multer

Environment: dotenv

🚀 Getting Started
To run this project in your local environment, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Node.js (version 18 or newer is recommended)

npm (usually installed with Node.js)

An API Key from Google AI Studio

Installation
Clone this repository:

git clone [https://github.com/Raihanmrafi/Chatbot_Gemini2.0.git](https://github.com/Raihanmrafi/Chatbot_Gemini2.0.git)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Chatbot_Gemini2.0

Install all dependencies:

npm install

Create the environment file:
Create a file named .env in the project's root directory and fill it with your API Key.

# .env
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"

Run the server:

node index.js

Your server is now running at http://localhost:3000.

🔌 API Usage
Here's how to use each available endpoint. You can use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or curl to test them.

1. Generate from Text
Endpoint: POST /generate-text

Body: application/json

curl Example:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"prompt": "Write a poem about coffee in the morning"}' \
http://localhost:3000/generate-text

2. Generate from Image
Endpoint: POST /generate-from-image

Body: multipart/form-data

curl Example:

curl -X POST -F "image=@/path/to/your/image.jpg" \
-F "prompt=Describe what is unique about this image" \
http://localhost:3000/generate-from-image

3. Generate from Document
Endpoint: POST /generate-from-document

Body: multipart/form-data

curl Example:

curl -X POST -F "document=@/path/to/your/document.pdf" \
-F "prompt=Summarize this document in 3 key points" \
http://localhost:3000/generate-from-document

4. Generate from Audio
Endpoint: POST /generate-from-audio

Body: multipart/form-data

curl Example:

curl -X POST -F "audio=@/path/to/your/audio.mp3" \
http://localhost:3000/generate-from-audio

(Note: The prompt for audio is hardcoded to "Transcribe or analyze the following audio : ")
